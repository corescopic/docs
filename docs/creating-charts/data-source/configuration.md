# Configuration

While creating a chart, you can choose between two data source query types:

- CQL (corescopic Query Language)
  CQL is an [open-source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@corescopic/cql) language build to simplify creating queries for analysis. It is an abstraction above SQL as it gets compiled down to SQL before being executed.
- Traditional SQL
  corescopic also allows you to use normal SQL queries to get data for charts.

On the next pages we'll describe more on how to write queries using these two languages.
